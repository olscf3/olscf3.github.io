    My name is Olivia Sifuentes. I am majoring in computer science. I am currently a freshman. My previous web development expirence consisted of building a non-interactive website from a template that doesn't require coding to add the material. I am currently in CMP_SC 1050 learning the C language. My expectations for this course are to learn the basics of web development and build a website that I can put on a resume. After this class, I hope to progress my skills further by taking more classes. I would love to master more of the design aspect of web development. Learning more about web development is useful because it teaches you more about the process of the internet. My favorite hobby is crocheting. My favorite thing to crochet is stuffed animals. I also sell these from time to time. I like to take walks, clean, draw, and listen to music in my free time.
