            <p>This website contains my work experience in chronological order for viewers. 
                The purpose of this website is to display most of my experience as a worker 
                and self-reflect on the different types of jobs and settings I have worked in. 
                This website aims to take the viewers on a journey of most of my past and current 
                work experiences. This journey will include the lessons I have learned as a worker.
                As well as a personal reflection about each of the different job positions. This will 
                also share the different strengths I've discovered I had while working at each job. 
                This website intends to share a more detailed work experience that I cannot fully explain 
                in my resume. After viewers have seen the content shared on this website, they will know my 
                qualities as a worker. This website will also demonstrate my basic understanding of web 
                development and design.</p>
