        <h2>Education Overview</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>I am currently working to get a bachelor’s degree in computer science. I am currently attending The University of Missouri. The expected completion date for this degree will be the fall of 2026. So far, my experience with technology courses taken in high school and college consists of first-level classes in computer-integrated manufacturing, digital electronics, engineering design and development, basic C programming, and basic web development.</p>

        <p>One of my favorite quotes is by Winston Churchill, 
            <blockquote>“Success is not final; failure is not fatal; it is the courage to continue that counts.”</blockquote>
        <p>This quote reminds the fact that life doesn’t stop after one event, good or bad. The will and <strong>motivation</strong> to continue life and complete my goals is a continuous cycle that will help me develop a successful life.</p>
