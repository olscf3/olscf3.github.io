                        In November of 2022, I left Hy-Vee to work at TJmaxx. My starting position was as a cashier. The purpose of this position was to scan items and assist the customer in purchasing. Another purpose of being a cashier was to sell TJmaxx memberships. This membership consists of a credit card that gives you 5% back in rewards per purchase. The main goal of being a cashier is to sell this membership to customers. After succeeding as a cashier, I was trained as a Sales Associate. The purpose of a Sales Associate is to make sure the store is in good condition, answer customersâ€™ questions, and make sure all merchandise is put out on the floor. The tasks of this job consist of fully reorganizing sections of the store, relabeling ticket prices as clearance, and putting new merchandise from the backroom out on the sales floor. After mastering the role of a Sales Floor Associate, I was then trained in how to work in the back room. The purpose of working in the back room is to unwrap, sort, and censor new merchandise delivered from a truck. The tasks of this position are cleaning and putting out new merchandise on the sales floor if the area gets backed up. I am currently still working at this job.
