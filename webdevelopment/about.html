            <h3> About Me</h3>
            <p>My name is Olivia Sifuentes. I am currently working to get a bachelor’s degree in computer science.</p> 
            <p>I am currently attending The University of Missouri. The expected completion date for this degree will be </p>
            <p>the fall of 2026. I am interested in pursuing the <em>software development</em> side of computer science.</p> 
            <p>I enjoy <em>desiging</em> and formatting the outputs of what I create. So far, my experience with technology</p> 
            <p>courses taken in high school and college consists of first-level classes in computer-integrated manufacturing,</p> 
            <p>digital electronics, engineering design and development, basic C programming, and basic web development. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>One of my favorite quotes is by Winston Churchill, 
                <blockquote>“Success is not final; failure is not fatal; it is the 
                    courage to continue that counts.”</blockquote>
            <p>This quote reminds the fact that life doesn’t stop after one event, good</p>
            <p>or bad. The will and <strong>motivation</strong> to continue life and complete my goals is a continuous cycle that will help </p>
            <p>me develop a successful life.</p>
