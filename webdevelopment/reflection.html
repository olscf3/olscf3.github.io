               During my short time in the workforce, I have developed and learned important qualities. 
               These qualities came from jobs that had customer service, food service, and retail employee 
               positions. The skills I have built consist of customer service, food service, speed, organization 
               skills, time management, staying clean, staying on task, delivering good quality products to 
               customers, and working in a team. Majoring in computer science has heightened my interest in 
               technology. Specifically learning how software is developed and how it functions with hardware 
               and other programs. The thing I love most about software is designing its output for consumers. 
               I have always had a creative mindset. Designing the output of a website, app, or code is something 
               I am interested in mastering.

            <p>My current career goal is to leave Panda Express and TJ Maxx to work at a local T-Mobile store. 
                Achieving this goal will build customer experience in dealing with issues that require troubleshooting. 
                This job will also be my first credible job out of all my experience. It will also introduce me 
                to a small part of the technology workforce and teach me about the current technology being released.
                My future career goal is to graduate college in a major that I love and a degree that is mostly 
                accepted in the workforce. I also want to have completed at least two internships before graduation. 
                After graduation, it is my goal to find my first professional job that begins with a livable salary.
