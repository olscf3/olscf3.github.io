                In the summer of 2021 after my birthday, I decided to start working at Taco Bell for my first job. I began work as a Customer Service Champion. This job position's purpose was to take customer's food orders and handle their payment transactions at the drive-thru and lobby. The tasks of this job are to make sure the lobby and drive-thru are clean and stocked with food and drink materials. This consists of sauce packets, lids, straws, soda syrup, paper bags to put food in, and sweeping the floors. After mastering this job position, I began training as a Food Service Champion. The purpose of this position is to make the food for customers in the drive-thru and lobby at a fast pace. Tasks within this position consisted of making sure everything was swept, every ingredient in the kitchen was stocked, and wiping off materials when needed. I left this job in August of 2022 to work for Hy-Vee.

                    In November of 2022, I left Hy-Vee to work at TJmaxx. My starting position was as a cashier. The purpose of this position was to scan items and assist the customer in purchasing. Another purpose of being a cashier was to sell TJmaxx memberships. This membership consists of a credit card that gives you 5% back in rewards per purchase. The main goal of being a cashier is to sell this membership to customers. After succeeding as a cashier, I was trained as a Sales Associate. The purpose of a Sales Associate is to make sure the store is in good condition, answer customersâ€™ questions, and make sure all merchandise is put out on the floor. The tasks of this job consist of fully reorganizing sections of the store, relabeling ticket prices as clearance, and putting new merchandise from the backroom out on the sales floor. After mastering the role of a Sales Floor Associate, I was then trained in how to work in the back room. The purpose of working in the back room is to unwrap, sort, and censor new merchandise delivered from a truck. The tasks of this position are cleaning and putting out new merchandise on the sales floor if the area gets backed up. I am currently still working at this job.

                    In early September of 2023, I decided to work at Panda Express. My position at this job is Back of House. The purpose of this position is to make food items of good quality for customers. To make food with good quality the restaurant needs to be clean, and the recipes given need to be followed to a tee. There are different stations within the kitchen to be trained 
                    on. The first position to be trained in is the sides station. Chow Mein, fried rice, white rice, and teriyaki are made in this station. The second position is called Main. In this station, you cook fried entrees in a wok, run the fryer, and fry appetizers. The last position is stir-fry. The purpose of this position is to cook entrees that include raw meat in a wok. The cleaning tasks each night cover the whole restaurant. Tasks such as degreasing the ceiling, moping and sweeping the 
                    freezer and cooler, washing all parts of each station, wiping down shelves holding clean dishes, and washing drain filters.
